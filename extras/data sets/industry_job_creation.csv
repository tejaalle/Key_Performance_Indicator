Footnotes:,,,,,,
1,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV). For the indicators for data from the first quarter of 2015, refer to Appendix B of the Guide to the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. Comparisons of data from the first quarter of 2015 with data from subsequent quarters should be made with caution. Starting with the second quarter of 2015, quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent (CV between 0% and 4.99%); B - Very good (CV between 5% and 9.99%); C - Good (CV between 10% and 14.99%); D - Acceptable (CV between 15% and 24.99%); E - Use with caution (CV between 25% and 34.99%); F - Too unreliable to publish (CV greater than or equal to 35%, or sample size is too small to produce reliable estimates).",,,,,
2,"Industry estimates starting in 2018 Q3 are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Version 3.0 and those prior to 2018 Q3 are based on the NAICS 2017 Version 2.0. The following categories are excluded from the survey: 'Religious organizations' (8131) within 'Religious, grant-making, civic, and professional and similar organizations' (813), 'Private households' (814), 'Federal, government public administration' (911), 'Provincial and territorial public administration' (912) and 'International and other extra-territorial public administration' (919).",,,,,
3,"The employment estimates from the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) are calibrated to the employment estimates from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) at the North American Industry Classification System sector (NAICS2) level by province. For this reason, JVWS employment may vary from SEPH at the subsector (NAICS3) level.",,,,,
4,"A job is vacant if it meets the following conditions: it is vacant on the reference date (first day of the month) or will become vacant during the month; there are tasks to be carried out during the month for the job in question; and the employer is actively seeking a worker outside the organization to fill the job. The jobs could be full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, casual, or seasonal. Jobs reserved for subcontractors, external consultants, or other workers who are not considered employees, are excluded.",,,,,
5,"The 'employee' concept used in the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) is comprised of full-time employees, part-time employees, as well as permanent, casual, temporary, and seasonal employees. It also includes working owners, directors, partners, and other officers of incorporated businesses, as well as employees who work at home or on the road but report to the location. The ‘employee' concept used in the JVWS is meant to exclude owners or partners of unincorporated businesses and professional practices, the self-employed, subcontractors, external consultants, unpaid family workers, persons working outside Canada, and military personnel. It also excludes employees on unpaid leave, such as those on extended sick leave who are receiving insurance benefits.",,,,,
6,"The job vacancy rate is the number of job vacancies expressed as a percentage of labour demand; that is, all occupied and vacant jobs.",,,,,
7,"The average hourly wage offered by employers for vacant positions. It excludes overtime, tips, commissions and bonuses. Salaries are converted to hourly wages based on information regarding the frequency of pay and the expected average number of hours worked per week. The offered wage may be different from the actual wage paid once the position is filled. If the salary is different among the job vacancies for the same occupation, the respondent is asked to report the lowest wage or salary. When the compensation advertised for the job vacancy is in the form of a salary range or an hourly pay range, the respondent is asked to report the lowest value of the range. If the work will be paid based on, for example, the number of parts produced, mileage or the number of times a task is performed, the respondent is asked to report the expected minimum salary.",,,,,
8,"Due to the reduced sample size in the first quarter of 2015, the Finance and insurance (52) and Management of companies and enterprises (55) sectors were calibrated to a combined total from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours for the first quarter of 2015 only.",,,,,
9,"Excludes 'Religious organizations' (8131) within 'Religious, grant-making, civic, and professional and similar organizations' (813) as well as 'Private households' (814).",,,,,
10,"Excludes 'Federal, government public administration' (911), 'Provincial and territorial public administration' (912) and 'International and other extra-territorial public administration' (919).",,,,,
